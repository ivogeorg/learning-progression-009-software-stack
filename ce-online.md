# Lesson & assignments after 008

## Hardware branch
1. Need better serial support, in particular I2C. This will lead to micro:bit peripherals.
   1. Sensors & actuators.
   2. External memory.
   3. WiFi.
2. Lookup tables after multiplexors. This leads to FPGAs.
3. As a continuation of logic gates and computational components, FPGA (say, [TinyFPGA](https://tinyfpga.com/)) programming after 008 (logic gates) and 009 (computation).
4. FPGAs lead to designing computers (probably just 8-bit ones with TinyFPGA).
5. This may lead to Verilog-programmable FPGA (probably higher-end), then transition to denser fabric designs for VLSI, and further into ASIC and SOC design.
   - Google TPU
6. RISC-V.
7. Novel processor design (ML, AI, etc).

- [Program](https://www.msudenver.edu/cpe/program/)
- [Catalog entry](https://catalog.msudenver.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=26&poid=6946#)

1. Problematic CE topics:
   - comms (a & d comms, advanced comms): _requires potentially expensive equipment_
   - power: _safety considerations_
     - actually missing from CPE
     - some in [EET](https://www.msudenver.edu/eet/)
   - VLSI: _requires expensive equipment_
   - AC circuits: _requires oscilloscope_
2. CE topics with no labs:
   - signals & systems
   - solid state device fundamentals (solid state electronics uses discrete elements and the lab is on uses)
   - a & d comms
   - control systems
   - computer networks
   - system reliability
   - security
   - multimedia
3. Missing from curriculum:
   - OS
